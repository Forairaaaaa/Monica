Button is a tiny library to make reading buttons very simple. It handles debouncing automatically, and monitoring of state.

Motivation
----------
Ahh buttons. Ahh debouncing! Sometimes you really wish you could ignore all the mechanics of debouncing, reading inputs, monitoring state, and just say... `if (button.pressed())` and know that it'll only run once each time you press a button.

Or how about `if (button.released())`, or `button.toggled()`. It is such a simple concept, but in practice you need to set up timers, monitor input puts, set pullups, etc etc. On anything more than the most simple example, that can become quite a headache.

So fed up with all that I figured there had to be a better way. This library is the result.

Features
--------
* Super simple API.
* Handles debouncing.
* Sets the pin mode automatically.
* Lets you write code that triggers:
** based on the pin state (high or low)
** when a button is pressed
** when a button is released
** or when a button changes (i.e. pressing or releasing)

Requirements
------------
* An Arduino â€” http://arduino.cc/
* A button

Installation
------------
Download the ZIP archive (https://github.com/madleech/Button/zipball/master), then open the Arduino IDE and choose Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library... and select your downloaded file.

You should now see in File > Examples > Button entires for the basic\_usage example.

Code Examples
-------------
Here is the 'basic\_usage' example program, included in the download:

```C++
#include <Button.h>

Button button1(2); // Connect your button between pin 2 and GND
Button button2(3); // Connect your button between pin 3 and GND
Button button3(4); // Connect your button between pin 4 and GND

void setup() {
    button1.begin();
    button2.begin();
    button3.begin();

    while (!Serial) { }; // for Leos
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    if (button1.pressed())
        Serial.println("Button 1 pressed");

    if (button2.released())
        Serial.println("Button 2 released");

    if (button3.toggled()) {
        if (button3.read() == Button::PRESSED)
            Serial.println("Button 3 has been pressed");
        else
            Serial.println("Button 3 has been released");
    }
}
```

Documentation
-------------
**Button(int pin)**
Creates a new Button.

**void begin()**
Call this in your `setup` method to setup the button. All it does is set the correct pin mode.

**bool pressed()**
Returns true when _and only when_ the button is pressed. Until the button is released (in the debounced-sense of the word) this function won't return true again. So in effect, it returns true only while you are pressing the button, or to put it another way, it fires on a rising edge.

**bool released()**
Like `pressed()`, but round the other way. So if you hold down a button, and then release it... that is when it fires.

**bool toggled()**
Returns true whenever the button is pressed or released, i.e., its position is toggled. To find out what the position actually is, you can use the `read()` function.

**bool read()**
Returns the current debounced state of the button, i.e. Button::PRESSED or Button::RELEASED.

**bool has_changed()**
Returns whether the position/state of the button has changed after calling the previous read() function. Unlikely to be used except by Super Gurus.

Quirks and Things to Keep in Mind
---------------------------------
**Highs and lows, lows and highs**
The easiest way to connect a switch on an Arduino is to connect it between an input pin and ground, and use the internal pullup resistor to make sure it doesn't float. This is fine and dandy, but it can get a bit confusing, as a "pressed" button is logic level: low, while a "released" button is logic level: high.

So to make it a bit more obvious what you're talking about, you can use a couple of handy shortcuts: `Button::PRESSED` and `Button::RELEASED` which map to the expected values.
